# Example: Rendering Modes

This example shows both usage modes of `custom_rules`:
- With `use_templatefile_rendering = true` (high-level DSL)
- With `use_templatefile_rendering = false` (manual statement)

## Usage

```bash
cd examples/usage_modes
terraform init
terraform plan
```

You should see both modules rendering rules correctly.
